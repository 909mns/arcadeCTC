<div id="game1"></div>

<h2>This is a timed clicking game. Each time you click the donut, it immediately moves to a new position and your score increases by one.
You have 15 seconds to click the donut as many times as possible. The donut can appear anywhere on the screen, so you need to react quickly and follow it with your mouse.
Try to get the highest score before time runs out!</h2>
